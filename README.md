## Task 1 ( Custom Command )

This task is a **Bash scripting exercise** aimed at replicating the core functionalities of the `grep` command.  
The goal was to create a lightweight script named `mygrep.sh` that can:

- Search for a specific string inside a file.
- Support optional flags like:
  - `-n` to display line numbers alongside matching lines.
  - `-v` to invert the match and show non-matching lines.
  - Combined options like `-vn` or `-nv`.
- Provide helpful usage instructions with a `--help` flag.
- Handle errors gracefully, such as missing files or arguments.

The script manually parses command-line arguments without using advanced tools like `getopts`, making it an excellent learning experience for handling flags and inputs at a basic level.

Through this task, I practiced and strengthened my skills in:

- Bash scripting
- Argument parsing
- String matching and manipulation
- File reading and error handling
- Building user-friendly CLI tools

This mini-project not only simulated how powerful command-line utilities work under the hood, but also gave me a deeper appreciation of shell scripting techniques.
